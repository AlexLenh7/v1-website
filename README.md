# alexlenh.com v1

The first and possibly last iteration of my personal portfolio. Designed to showcase projects and my journey in software development. Built with React and CSS on Vite and hosted with Vercel.

## Currently WIP

I'm still adding projects and adjusting / adding new features. However the majority of the website is completely functional.

Things I might add in the future:

- add customizable color theme
- maybe add a backend for more interactions
