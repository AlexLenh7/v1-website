      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p className="about-p1">
        I am an aspiring software engineer and a current Computer Science student at San Diego State University, set to
        graduate in May 2025. With a solid academic foundation in Data Structures, Algorithms, and Database Theory, I
        have maintained a 3.6 GPA while mastering a diverse technical stack that includes JavaScript, Python, Java, and
        SQL. My background combines theoretical knowledge with practical application, making me well-equipped to
        contribute to frontend, backend, or full-stack development teams.
      </p>
      <p className="about-p2">
        My hands-on experience is highlighted by building comprehensive full-stack web applications and backend
        services. I have a proven track record of developing reusable component architectures using ReactJS and
        engineering scalable backend solutions with Node.js and Express. From designing dynamic server-rendered pages
        with EJS to implementing secure database layers using PostgreSQL and Sequelize ORM, I have consistently focused
        on creating efficient, responsive, and user-centric applications.
      </p>
      <p className="about-p3">
        I am a highly adaptable developer with a passion for learning and integrating emerging technologies, as
        demonstrated by my integration of Google's Gemini API to automate workflows and my leadership in developing a
        TensorFlow-based facial recognition system. Beyond traditional development, I have experience in UNIX system
        administration and cloud environments, where I automated security protocols and managed virtual infrastructures.
        I am eager to apply this versatile skill set to a junior role where I can continue to evolve alongside changing
        technologies and contribute to impactful software solutions.
